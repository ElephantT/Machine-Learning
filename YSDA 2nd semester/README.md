2nd semester of Machine Learning at Yandex School of Data Analysis:
1. seminar 1 - NN and CV
   - Conv layers theory
   - PyTorch intro
   - A lot of different PyTorh datasets (CIFAR10 & 100, variations of MNIST, CelebA, STL10, SVHN) and dataloaders
   - NN on dense layers for CV (design, optimization, learning loop, traing and etc)
   - NN on conv layers for CV (design, optimization, learning loop, traing and etc)
   - Representations: NN intermidiate results, Convolutional representation, t-SNE
   - Improving convolutional models quality (augmentantations and etc)
   - Finetuning and transfer learning
