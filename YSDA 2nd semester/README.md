2nd semester of Machine Learning at Yandex School of Data Analysis:
1. seminar 1 - NN and CV
   - Conv layers theory
   - PyTorch intro
   - A lot of different PyTorh datasets (CIFAR10 & 100, variations of MNIST, CelebA, STL10, SVHN) and dataloaders
   - NN on dense layers for CV (design, optimization, learning loop, traing and etc)
   - NN on conv layers for CV (design, optimization, learning loop, traing and etc)
   - Representations: NN intermidiate results, Convolutional representation, t-SNE
   - Improving convolutional models quality (augmentantations and etc)
   - Finetuning and transfer learning
2. seminar 2 - NLP, RNNs and Embeddings
   - RNNs - RNN, LSTM, GRU, bi-Directional and etc
   - Datasets - AG_NEWS, Yahoo answers and etc
   - Full rnns training process
   - Embeddings - word2vec (CBOW, Skip-gram), GloVe, FastText, ELMo
3. seminar 3 - DL tricks, STL10 dataset
   - Implementation of nn with residual blocks
   - Finetuning and Transfer learning
   - LR schedules
   - How to fight overfitting + other tricks: warm up, label smoothing, gradient clipping, learn on addversatial attacked data, knowledge distilation and etc
